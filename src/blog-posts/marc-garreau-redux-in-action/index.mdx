summary: After searching for the "redux book" phrase, you will have a few options - Redux in Action by Marc Garreau is one of them. If you wonder if it is worth getting it - read the short review and decide.
---

## Introduction

To stay loyal to a format that I took on the first review - I will sum up the main parts of the book, review them one by one and give some alternatives.

I checked the official documentation and related articles to have a good comparison of what is included in the book, or what might be missing, so get ready!

## Fundamentals

As usually at the start - we are getting an overall view of the basics. This part covers all about Flux architecture, what it is, and what problems try to solve.

If you had any experience with Redux, then you are probably aware of its structure. Dispatchers, stores, actions, action creators, middlewares, and selectors, plus unidirectional data flow and other related aspects - this is what you get from these chapters.

Don't forget about the three main principles of Flux:
- single source of truth
- read-only state
- pure function for handling state changes

And we are about to get ready for the next chapters.

#### As you probably expected - this kind of information might be easy to find:
- [Official docs core concepts](https://redux.js.org/introduction/core-concepts)
- [Intro from Facebook](https://facebook.github.io/flux/)
- [FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq/general)

## Starting with CRA and task management app

In this part, the author takes on a base app configuration, creating components, redux lifecycle (actions, reducers, store), and connecting it to React components.

Common Redux code is supported by flow graphs and code blocks that will help you understand basic concepts.

Explanations are clear and provided code is easy to follow. It is a dead-simple feature - kind of TODO list at this stage. No side effects, no complicated patterns - this is what you should expect from the introduction, and this is what you get.

Worth noticing - the author gives some simple exercises that you can take on if you wish. They are related to the flow and will be explained (and solved) right after listing.

#### Alternatives:
- [Redux docs](https://redux.js.org/introduction/learning-resources)
- [Redux debugging](https://blog.logrocket.com/redux-devtools-tips-tricks-for-faster-debugging/)

## Working with API and async actions

This part is all about connecting your app to an outside world - splitting action creators into synchronous and asynchronous, adding popular thunk middleware, and handling requests (side effects) inside action creators.

Besides the Redux-related code, you will get more exercises, some error handling, and connecting to React components.

#### Alternatives:
- [Thunk docs](https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-logic-thunks)
- [Error handling](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-redux-displaying-error-messages)

## Middleware

As the section name might suggest - we are getting info about middleware here. Starting with the basic concepts through logging middleware to replacing regular API calls made with thunks.

As before, exercises and solutions with code blocks are waiting for you at the end of each section.

#### Alternatives:
- [Middleware docs](https://redux.js.org/understanding/history-and-design/middleware)
- [Middleware API on video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gjiu7Lgdg3s)

## Complex side effects (with redux-saga)

If you have any experience with sagas, you might have a strong opinion about them already. If you don't - it's good to take a look at them. When it comes to some more complicated side effects - they might be handy.

Besides sagas, you will get some background about generators and iterators.

As in previous parts - pros and cons plus alternatives are discussed.

#### Alternatives:
- [Sagas docs](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [Sagas vs thunks](https://medium.com/@shoshanarosenfield/redux-thunk-vs-redux-saga-93fe82878b2d)

## Redux selectors, memoization, composition, and normalization

It's time to introduce the case of memoization and composition with Redux selectors. Practices for splitting functions that process data and ways of organizing them is the name of this part.

The second name is a normalization of the store shown on an example with its pros and cons.

Overall - pretty interesting chapters with solid fundamentals and common problems that you might see in your application will be explained.

#### Alternatives:
- [Normalizr for normalization](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)
- [Reselect for selectors](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect)
- [Docs](https://redux.js.org/introduction/learning-resources#normalization)

## Everyone's favorite time - time for testing

As for everyone, it's my favorite part as well. Testing every kind of action creators, store, sagas, React components - is what developers love to do.

Well, at least you get recipes for most common cases here, so it should be a little bit less painful for the future.

#### Alternatives:
- [Docs](https://redux.js.org/introduction/ecosystem#testing)

## Performance
Another interesting chapter. Besides ways of checking performance, multiple ways to increase it are listed. Related to Redux itself and React as well.

To name a few:
- caching
- action batching
- organizing connect()
- memoization
- React lifecycle methods (shouldUpdate, pure component)
- pagination

#### Alternatives:
- [Docs](https://redux.js.org/faq/performance#performance)
- [Connecting lists](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2017/01/practical-redux-part-6-connected-lists-forms-and-performance/)


## Structuring Redux
The last of the important chapters. Shows common ways of organizing code and files/ folders.

Takes on three main methods:
- Group by type
- Group by feature
- Redux ducks

## Conclusion

Overall - it is a solid position if you need an introduction or to refresh your knowledge. 

Progression makes sense, and most of the common concerns are covered.

Pros and cons of each introduced subject and potential alternatives are the things that I would like to see more often in tech-related content.

Exercises and solutions are strictly related to the app, so you can try to implement them on your own.

There are small cons tho, the book is not from the time when Redux toolkit got introduced, so it's not covered. I miss an example of a higher-order reducer with some HOC action as well.

Anyway, it's a position worth recommending if you are up to reading more than watching.
